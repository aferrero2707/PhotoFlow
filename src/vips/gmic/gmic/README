# In a nutshell
#---------------

 G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image processing, distributed
 under the CeCILL license (GPL compatible).
 It provides several different user interfaces to convert/manipulate/filter/
 visualize generic image datasets, ranging from 1d scalar signals to 3d+t
 sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images, thus including 2d color images.

 These user interfaces are:

 1 - A command-line interface gmic, to use the G'MIC image processing features
     from a shell. In this setting, G'MIC may be seen as a friendly companion to
     the ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick software suites.

 2 - A small, portable, thread-safe and multi-threaded, C++ image processing
     library libgmic, to be linked to third-party applications. Its simple API
     allows programmers to add all G'MIC features in their own software without
     much efforts (a C API is provided as well).

 3 - A plug-in gmic_gimp, to bring G'MIC capabilities to the image retouching
     software GIMP. More than 450 filters are already available, sorted by
     category (Artistic, Black & white, Colors, Contours, Deformations,
     Degradations, Details, Film emulation, Frames, Layers, Light & shadows,
     Patterns, Rendering, Repair, Sequences, etc.).

 4 - A web service G'MIC Online, to allow users applying image processing
     algorithms on their images, directly from a web browser.

 5 - A Qt-based interface ZArt, for real-time processing of video streaming
     coming from webcams or video files.

 G'MIC is an open framework: the default script language can be extended with
 custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image available filters or
 effects. By the way, it already contains a substantial set of pre-defined image
 processing algorithms and pipelines (more than 1000).

 G'MIC has been designed with portability in mind, and runs on different
 platforms (Windows, Unix, MacOSX). It is distributed under the CeCILL license
 (GPL-compatible). Since 2008, it has been developed in the Image Team of the
 GREYC laboratory, in Caen/France, by permanent researchers working in the field
 of image processing on a daily basis.

 Purchasing commercial licenses for using G'MIC in closed-source
 applications is possible. Contact us if you are interested in getting one.

 The C++ source code of G'MIC is distributed under the CECILL v.2.0 license
 (file 'CeCILL.rtf'). This License is a Free-Software license, compatible with
 the GPL (using those files in a distributed closed-source project is then
 forbidden).
