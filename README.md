PhotoFlow [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow.svg?branch=stable)](https://travis-ci.org/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow)
=========

The aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive photo retouching program with a complete workflow including RAW image development.

Here is the general feature (wish)list:

- Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image
- Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis
- Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying rendering engine based on the VIPS library
- Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...
- Support for layer grouping and layer masks
- Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers

You can follow the development of photoflow and learn about its usage in the dedicated blog: http://photoflowblog.blogspot.fr/

# Windows and macOS installers

Up-to-date Windows and macOS installers are available from the [releases](https://github.com/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow/releases) web page.

# Installing from PPA (Ubuntu Linux and derivate distributions)

There are up-to-date packages available for Ubuntu 14.04/14.10 and Mint 17/17.1 in two diferent PPAs:

- *Highly Explosive* PPA:

To add the PPA and install photoflow, do the following:

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install photoflow

or to install the daily git builds from the "stable" branch:

        sudo apt-get install photoflow-git

# Installing from official Debian (sid+) or Ubuntu (20.10+)

        apt install photoflow

# Arch Linux packages

Pre-compiled packages are available from the [releases](https://github.com/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow/releases) web page. To install a given version, download the photoflow-git-x.x.x-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz archive (where `x.x.x` must be replaced with the version to be installed) and then run 

        sudo packman -U photoflow-git-x.x.x-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

To compile from sources, download the PKGBUILD file and run this command in the download directory:

        makepkg -i

# Fedora packages

User Oleastre is providing up-to-date VIPS and PhotoFlow packages for Fedora.

To install PhotoFlow, just execute the following commands as root:

        dnf copr enable oleastre/PhotoFlow
        dnf install photoflow

Additional details can be found here: https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/oleastre/PhotoFlow/

# Downloading and compiling

Photoflow can be compiled under both gtk 2.x and gtk 3.x.

The pixel rendering engine of PhotoFlow is based on VIPS (http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk). You have to install a recent version of VIPS in order to compile PhotoFlow.

Once VIPS is set up and running, follow these steps to download and compile PhotoFlow:

1. get master branch from GitHub:

        $ git clone https://github.com/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow.git

2. The build system is based on CMake, so you have to have it installed in your system.
   You need the following dependencies to build Photoflow: gettext, glib-2.x, libxml-2.0, pkg-config, swig, gtk-doc-tools, automake, gobject-introspection, gnu make, cmake, libtiff, libjpeg, libfftw3, exiv2, lensfun and gtkmm-2.x or gtkmm-3.x.
   PhotoFlow provides an helper script to simplify the building process;
   in order to use it you have to go into the "build" subdirectory and run the "build.sh" script:

        $ cd PhotoFlow/build
        $ bash ./build.sh
   
   If you have installed VIPS in an unusual place, you can edit the build script and set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable accordingly

   To compile the code in debug mode, use
   
        $ bash ./build.sh debug
   
   instead.
   
   If you do not already have a very recent version of VIPS installed in your system, a second helper script is provided 
   which will download, configure and compile libvips for you, and link it against photoflow:
   
        $ cd PhotoFlow/build
        $ bash ./build_all.sh
   

3. If all goes well, you can now open an image file with PhotoFlow:

        $ ./Release/bin/photoflow image_file_name
        

# Current status

PhotoFlow is in a early development stage. The present version allows to open an image file and apply basic editing filters via non-destructive adjustment layers. The individual layers can be activated and de-activated using the radio buttons on the right of the image. Moreover, the layers structure can be saved to disk and re-opened again via the command line.
Loading and processing of RAW images (demosaicing, white balance, exposure adjustment, etc.) is now available, at least at a basic level.
