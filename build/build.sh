#! /bin/bash
#  Script:    build.sh
#  Purpose:   Build PhotoFlow, create starter scripts.
#  Call:      build.sh <Build-Type>
#             Build-Type: debug for a Debug Build,
#                         test  for a Test Build,
#                         else for a Release Build.
#  Environment Variables:
#  BUILD_TYPE     : the Build-Type as above. Optional.
#  INSTALL_PREFIX : the root directory for PhotoFlow's release, debug or test
#                   builds.
#                   Optional. If omitted, then this is the current directory.
#  LD_LIBRARY_PATH: a colon-separated list of directories where libraries
#                   should be searched before the standard directories.
#                   If VIPS_INSTALL_PREFIX is set, then this variable will
#                   be extended accordingly.
#  PKG_CONFIG_PATH: see "man pkg-config".
#                   If VIPS_INSTALL_PREFIX is set, then this variable will
#                   be extended accordingly.
#  VIPS_INSTALL_PREFIX: VIPS' install prefix. Optional.
#                   If omitted, then the system's libvips is used.
